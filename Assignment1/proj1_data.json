I earn very close to median income (yes, I checked it with data from the Australian Bureau of Statistics) for my city of residence. I just have the misfortune of living in a major city in Australia. House prices in Australia are ridiculously high. It amazes many people when they find out for the first time just how unaffordable houses in Australia are compared to the rest of the world. \n\nHere in Canberra, the median house price is $564,000. My two-bedroom apartment with 90 square metres (969 sq ft) of living space cost $500,000, and it was by no means in the upper end of the market. It was actually one of the cheaper real estate options. It will take me 30 years to pay off this debt.\n\nSydney is even worse. You can pay upwards of $700,000 for a two bedroom house an hour from the centre of the city, and if you're lucky you'll be near a train line.\n\nYou literally cannot buy real estate for cheaper than $250,000 within an hour's drive of where I live. The cheapest option on the market at just over 250k is typically a tiny 50ish sq metre studio apartment with no bedrooms and shared laundry facilities. Yes, it's cheaper in regional areas, but &gt;60% (maybe &gt;70%) of people in my country live in cities where they are looking at over 400,000 for a place to live. \n\nI understand that this is a lot of money to a lot of people, but I was more reflecting on the fact that this advice would not be received quite the same way for many people in my country.\n\nEdit - I'm not saying 10k is nothing. It's a substantial sum of money to me too. It just pales into insignificance next to the cost of a house.\n\nEdit 2 - a house worth 500k easily turns into a loan worth over a million of repayments over the 30 year period.

I figured, in my juvenile stupidity, that meant that I was automatically better than everyone else. I put a lot of value in my mind and the result was basically a fortress of pride.

I wasn't good at them, so therefore they must be stupid. Being able bring my faults to a conversation in a way that would benefit the group was my first step toward becoming less 'iamverysmart'.

Most people are literally out to get laid, not make friends (of the opposite sex) or at least they have this odd hope that they might. \n\nPlatonic relationships between two hot people who find each other sexually attractive are extremely difficult and tend not to be completely honest. Often times you don't know what is motivated by sexuality and what by honest desire for friendship.\n\nI don't do one night stands, because \"mechanical\" sex is not worth it. I can go jerk off and have the matter settled in 10 mins. Or I can spend hours, even days potentially with some lady just so I can get to bone her? Not worth it.

My cousin (let's call him T) had always been undateable and a total social retard, making him very difficult to get s long with.  Regardless of this, I felt sorry for him and would invite him to things from time to time to get him out (and usually regretted it because people would be mad I brought him...justified).  \n\nAnyways, I'm engaged to be married in 6-9 or so months, and I told my cousin I found her on eharmony and he should try it out (because again, undateable for most people).  He finds a girl and they quickly get engaged (she's weird too, but better than him).  They plan their wedding right before ours, and in Vegas.  T also asks me to be his best man because no one else can stand him.  I said fine because I'm way too nice.  So not only do they sneak in their wedding right before ours, but he makes my wife and I spend a ton of money at the drop of a hat to fly out to Vegas, buy a bunch of shit, and take him out for a bachelor party.  This is right before my wedding that I'm supposed to be preparing for in a time crunch, and has already drained my bank account substantially (I didn't want her mom to have to pay like she wanted to).  Anyways, I gave him a great bachelor party with no notice, and sucked it up on the rest.  \n\nIn talking with him later, it sounded like he was expecting to be in my wedding, if not as best man.  Wrong (I already had a more than enough groomsman, and one ended up needing to officiate).  I found him another job and tried to make it sound super important.  I had a song recorded for my wife (I wasn't the singer/instrument player to be clear), and he was to play it during our dance.  I even bought him a groomsman gift, and certain groomsman pieces like tie, shoes, etc so he could match us and feel included; basically went out of my way to make this guy that I see maybe a couple times a year feel good on OUR day.  \n\nHe shows up very late, misses the song part entirely (we had a friend of the wife do it as backup which didn't work at all, so we had to try again later), and then gets vocally pissed because he wasn't the one that got to do it.  He then starts getting drunk and even more vocal about how he should have been my best man because I was his (even though I didn't want to be and did it to be nice because he had no one else).  He also creeped out the maid of honor by creepily ogling her from the shadows. This was caught in what would have been done really good wedding photos. \n\nSo yea..not as much of a \"that bitch\" story, but a different spin.  \n\nI took him out for his birthday, and he got drunk and made a huge scene about it there too.

We both took off of work on a Friday and went to the courthouse with his mother, 2 brothers and 2 close friends of mine. After the ceremony we went to lunch and got pretty drunk before 5pm. This is where the plan began to form for the BIL (brother or bitch in law...your choice). I would be remiss to leave out the fact that I was aware that BIL had a raging drug problem but we hadn't had any incidents in say about 6 months so my antennas weren't up. BIG MISTAKE. So leaving from lunch/dinner BIL offers to chauffeur the newlyweds, no problem, I'm too wasted to drive. So we hop in my shiny red rental and ride to the hotel: super nice skyscraper with a rotating restaurant at the top. My boss had gifted us 2 suites on like the 55th floor. I was floating on air, and champagne, and plenty of pot. So after checking out the suites we all decide to go up to the restaurant : glass elevator takes you up on the outside of the building. BIL is still holding the keys and I'm feeling good. Don't know how much we drank there but it wasn't a whole lot. Now it's time to go back to our suites so we head to the elevator and it's a crowd waiting to board: we get on and right before the door closed BIL mumbled something and slid out the door. I remember my heart sinking as the elevator started descending...oh shit BIL has the keys! I screamed at my husband. So we go back to our suite...nope he isn't there. We had a shit ton of people start showing up so we commenced to partying ...HARD. Every time someone knocked on the door I would get a glimmer of hope...NOPE, just some more friends bringing booze and drugs. My husband and I would briefly lock eyes; shake our heads glumly and go back to get shit faced.  We check out, call my mother-in-law to come get us and head home. By this time I'm crying and pissed.  Now I'm torn between waiting for H.R. Puff n Stacks to return on his own or calling the cops and reporting the rental stolen. Meanwhile BIL is blaming ME! ( Bitch WHAT??????) Well you KNEW BIL has a drug problem, why did you let him drive you...shit like that. She convinced my dumb ass to wait until Monday to report the car. Monday morning hubby is driving me to work, we stop for gas and hubby spots the car. We pin the car in and forced the kid {maybe 14} to get out. The car had been hit on the back drivers side door. BIL checks into rehab (bullshit move), rental company cleans my bank account out ( had about 2100 in ill gotten gains....they took it all). Crappy way to start a crappy marriage.  \n\nSorry if I didn't do this right. This is my first time.

Let me tell you guys a story I've told on reddit before but it's my favorite story of all time. I was in band in high school and my senior year of high school I started dating this girl we'll call M. I had two previous girlfriends before her and both of them dumped me, my self esteem had been in the shitter so I just felt lucky to have a girlfriend at all. We went on a band trip to Bands Of America Grand Nationals in Indianapolis and literally 5 minutes into the bus ride there, one of my friends told me that M was texting him. \"Dude M just text me that she wants my dick. She is fucked up to do that to you man.\" Thanks Jared. I knew what I had to do but I didn't want to ruin my trip! It was a 5 day trip and I didn't want to spend it sad the entire time so I had planned on doing it when we got back. But then she started texting him more about \"oh jared I want your dick right now\" and I knew I had to do something.\n\nKeep in mind that around this time was when Donald Trump and The Apprentice was a huge TV hit. I loved how he did that weird hand motion and said \"you're fired\". It was awesome. On day 3 we went to Indy Motor Speedway and it was a great time. We got to make a lap around the track and they pulled over to let us look at the bricks that the drivers kiss before the race. I saw M there kissing the bricks and all I could think about was her kissing Jared's dick. I knew I had to dump her but I didn't know how to do it. So I went over to her and said \"Hey M......*hand motion* duuuuuuumped\" and walked off. Holy hell I felt great.

Their cultures were almost as diverse as the cultures that we have now [here]. And the truth is most of our history was 'wiped away' through slavery. Acting and being anything but \"White\" was discouraged and many people died from it. They did whatever they had to do to survive so if that meant shaving their hair, making it straight, stopping the spread of their native language(s), bleaching the skin, the list goes on... \n\nHow this is relevant is that at the time is that to differentiate between the \"darks\" and \"lights,\" Black people were called, well, Black. And White people were called- you get my drift. This is only in the United States of America. [Black](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_people) itself has different connotations all across the world so you will get different responses when you are calling someone from Brazil a Black person compared to someone from Canada or the United States. You'll notice that pretty much everyone who considers themselves to be Black will also acknowledge that they have a lot of African ancestry down the line, though. (There's the fact that Africa is also an incredibly huge continent and there are also White Africans so one would be under the assumption that if a White person from Africa comes to the USA that their race would be \"African American,\" but the reality is that they will still be called a White American. It's all based on looks.. It's an incredibly huge socially constructed value here in the USA).      \n\nAbout African American... Well, you can't tell whether someone is African American or not just by looking at them. Some people might be from Nigeria (an African country), so they might call themselves a Nigerian-American after they get their citizenship. There are over 50 countries in Africa &amp; I'm sure you can imagine the confusion this can cause. People form other countries simply **will not** get it because race is a social construct and yet it still means *so much*. \n\nThis is why \"Black\" is kind of a word that we can all agree on here in the US. No matter if we are Jamaican, Somalian, Canadian, American, Brazilian, whatever... We can kind of agree with it. \n\nYou can add \"racial mixing\" to the mix and acknowledge that not all people who are dark skinned are completely Black, yet they are still forced to identify as [only] Black. For example, my nephew is half Puerto Rican (they are racially mixed with Spanish/Taino/African) and half Black, so no matter what he identifies more with, he will always be [just] \"Black.\" This makes a lot of people mad, specifically people who may be mixed with 50/50 or even with 3 different backgrounds because society will only see one part of them. This can be sad for a person who is mixed with 'Black' or not.          \n\nAlso, the term \"Negro\" itself isn't offensive. It literally means Black in Spanish/Portuguese and comes from the Latin word 'niger' which also means Black. Believe it or not but at one point in time, \"negro\" was the politically correct word of choice. During the Civil Rights movement there was a divide in Black people about what our identity was because, well, it was wiped away from them. Some people wanted to get completely away from anything associated with the White people in America, so they decided to make up new terms. The White peoples' names for them went like this: n****r -&gt; colored -&gt; negro -&gt; and then there was a divide where the Black people themselves were divided in whether or not to choose from any of the following: Afro-American, Black American, and Negro. \n\nSome people still wanted to identify with the continent of Africa but understandably some grew up knowing *nothing* about where they were from &amp; with the White people treating you more harshly the more Black/African you identified with, they wanted to stay away from it. \n\nSo basically you got people of all ages with different economical backgrounds (some were mixed with White or were generally mixed-looking or flat out White-passing) and different political views (think: the more violent Malcom X versus Martin Luther King Jr.) trying to come up with the same end POV. It hasn't happened and still hasn't happened. Nowadays youth will use the words interchangeably-- well, except for \"negro\" and \"afro-american\" because those just sound weird, haha! But you'll get the oldest Black people still identifying with those outdated words. With that said there are still organizations, businesses, and college funds that used the term negro in them so the word 'negro' is completely okay when used for historical purposes. When you see young Black people calling other Black people negros, please know that 99% of them are not serious. They will look at you strange if you call them negros in the USA. \n\nWith that said, here's [one of my favorite](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8xJXKYL8pU) YouTube videos about apologizing if someone says what you've said offends them. You don't really have to agree with everything she says but it's a great way to do damage control. Just call Black people Black and you shouldn't ever have a problem in North America. Can't help you with other parts of the continent or other continents because 'race' means completely different things there but just be confident in your speaking and apologize even if you're thinking 'wtf? how the f#ck could that offend you?' and try not to twitch and you'll be fine, lol. :) Even I've had to do it &amp; re-educate myself. \n\nOkay, wow. So I am all over the world with my comment but I hope that I at least enlightened you a little bit. I am sorry if something I say is more confusing than it helps. I do hope that you won't be apprehensive about approaching us anymore, though.

Currently, there are four categories.\n-Suspected\n-Sympathizer(the only category for non-furries who are still considered enemies)\n-Closet\n-Unapologetic\n\nAn interesting trend I've noticed: The younger ones tend to lean more toward being unapologetically furry, while the older ones are almost always closet furries. I am worried I skimmed over a few possible Freshmen closet furries because of my predisposition that they'd automatically be flamboyant about it.\n\nI have information networks of people who I trust enough to let know I do this, people I have to ask several times before they sigh and give me more information about somebody they saw with a furry tail walking in the stairwell.

Speeches. If you're getting married soon, or ever, and you're trusting people to do speeches, tell them they need to run it by someone who has social graces first. Never give a speech at a wedding without testing it out in front of people!!! \n\nThe initial \"bitch\" moment was my husband's mistake, but it triggered a chain reaction that I'll never forget. It is burned into my brain no matter how hard I try to think of the other great stuff it is stuck there...\n\nMy now husband made a \"thank you for giving me this beautiful gift to unwrap\" joke to my parents in the middle of his speech. No one laughed. But no big deal really, the rest of the speech was great and he was actually moved to tears so, so were a bunch of other people. The rest of the speech was so good that it detracted from the awkwardness of the bad joke. \n\nWhen I bring this up I get mixed responses, some remember it and were quite shocked, some don't remember at all or are lying to me to spare my feelings? Not sure... Anyway, on to the actual bitch:\n\nMy sister did a speech before this and she has had some challenges in life. She's diagnosed bipolar and had to be hospitalized once. Before that there was a lot of self-medicating with alcohol, other substances, and men. When she went to deliver her speech, I was nervous, but we had spoken beforehand and she did a pretty heartfelt speech about me being her protector and alcohol supervisor etc. She said a lot about her partying and me giving good advice. It was PG13, and I was actually really proud of her.\n\nFast forward to my husband's joke. He thanks my parents for the gift to unwrap (barf in my mouth a little, awkward moment of silence follows) and then my unstable idiot uncle shouts out, \"You chose the wrong sister!\" And starts to laugh. \n\nThat's right folks, my uncle referred to my sister as a slut in front of my entire wedding party and my already embarrassed parents.\n\nWe never speak of this. My uncle still comes to holiday events because everyone knows he has mental health issues and it's not his fault...\n\nSame uncle was staying at a hotel off site. We did one of those weekend in the woods at a \"resort\" dealies and there wasn't enough room for everyone on site.  He and his equally socially gifted wife decided they would join us for brunch the next day. Brunch was included in each onsite guest's package and no one else was invited to join. When they showed up and the staff explained that to them, they asked to have their meals charged to my husband's and my tab. I have no idea why the staff allowed this, but it was on our bill when we left. Just to add salt to the wound...\n\nHis wife also moved a bunch of the name tags on the tables around. As though that wasn't thought out, or important for the waitstaff...\n\nMy uncle was \"that bitch.\"\n\n", "is_root": true, "controversiality": 0, "children": 0, "popularity_score": 2.0769378585186744}, {"text": "because I'm horrible at remembering medical terminology since I'm in and out of doctors and hospitals all the time. eventually it just becomes a big garbled mess that you hope you can come up with the right description for it.", "is_root": false, "controversiality": 0, "children": 1, "popularity_score": 1.8334934530603533}, {"text": "Bioshock Infinite's Burial At Sea.

We were dead broke, and called to ask him to give her a lift home.  He refused, saying he has just finished dinner.  I have no idea what one has to do with the other, but my wife still walked home 4 miles in the rain with whiplash.\n\n- A close family friend committed suicide on the same day our power went out, which was all on the same day we were supposed to return an empty old computer tower (Think 1990) to a different friend about an hour away.  My wife was in tears as she calls him to explain why we can't make it that day, and he started telling her off.\n\n- We made vacation plans and he bailed on them with zero notice to go out of the country with his uncle.  I didn't hear from him until he got back two weeks later.\n\n- You couldn't have a conversation with the guy without him blasting music all the way through it.  It got really obnoxious having to yell over Megadeth all the damn time. \n\n- She would call us to see what we were doing, we'd tell her what we were doing, then she'd come over and get pissed that we were doing what we told her we were doing.  Basically, she thought her presence in a room should change everybody's plans.\n\n- She tried to get my wife drunk and have her buddies fuck her, so she could break us up.\n\n- Abused his dog so badly it had to be put down.\n\n- Gets offended at every little thing.  You can't watch standup with him, you can't watch comedy movies.  The edgiest thing he's seen in years was The Box Trolls, which he said rattled him to his core.  Just a very squishy, humorless person.  Not a bad guy, just too annoying to spend time with.\n\n- Can't have a conversation without constantly trying to one-up whatever the topic is.  If it's a bad day at work, then you \"don't know real stress.\"  If you had a nice dinner out, he had the best dinner out at the most exclusive place.

He was also living in a cheap apartment complex, barely holding his head above water. The important part here is that the complex did not let people with drug charges live there.  So I, being his best friend, said \"hey, why don't you come live with me?\" \n\nI let this little bitch live in my house for free.  I was doing well, wasn't worried about the money.  But he didn't know that.  I've always been taught to keep my wealth secret.  \n\nSo one day, I come home and all of his shit is gone, and so is my TV. I called him, and asked if he knew where my TV was.  He got super mad that I asked him, which he took as an accusation.  In his defense, I was sure he did it.  In my defense, it turns out he was behind it.  \n\nSo anyway, he said no and hung up.  So obviously, I called the police to get a report.  They came, didn't do much.  They asked if I lived alone, and I said I had a roommate, but I doubt that he took it.  They ran his name, and saw that he was registered to my address, and wasn't at work.  That's a problem, because of his suspended license.  They found him, and took him in for the violation.  He happened to have a half ounce of the Devils lettuce on him. Another charge, 6 weeks in jail. \n\nHe runs his mouth all over town saying I snitched on him, turned my friends against me.  The whole thing.  \n\n3 months later I get a call from my cousin, she said she found my TV.  Apparently her dealer bought it from this fuccboi, my ex best friend.  \n\nNow, my cousin is not a very good person to fuck with.  She's a good person, but fuck can she be scary.  \n\nTLDR: some little bitch stole my TV, turned my friends against me, and is now a missing person.

Kylie had a very skewed outlook on the world. She took to extreme opinions and thoughts that were, after a while, very difficult to be around. She was obviously extremely depressed, unhappy with her body, and just in general, pretty miserable of a person. I did everything I could to help her. I'd listen to her vent, I'd be there for her when no one else was. But then she would turn all of her vehement hate for the world (truly thought that Hitler should make a comeback and exterminate everyone...seriously?) on me. I became her punching bag. Anytime I ever expressed any ounce of happiness, she would twist it and shove it down my throat. She hated my boyfriend for silly reasons and would frequently say he should kill himself. One day she finally crossed the line and said some things about me personally, to my face, that I could not forgive. I ended up removing her from any of my social media and blocking her. We still haven't spoken, and I find that my life is much brighter without her presence. She was one of those people who acted like an elitist; if I showed her my makeup, she'd act condescendingly toward it. If I told her some interesting fact I learned, she'd try to act above me, as if she suddenly were an expert on the topic. She'd ridicule me despite the fact that she couldn't hold a job, couldn't handle college, and could just never be wrong. Through half of our friendship, she criticized me for never standing up for myself. And then I finally did. Good riddance.

Apart from the fact that the two types of weather are massively different (winter storms are the result of a front, usually stretching hundreds of miles long, moving through an area,  whereas hurricanes and tropical storms are more localized, individual events)  and thus their naming system implies that the weather will all be the same along that whole front.  It'd be like if sunshine was predicted,  so the talking head they put up says \"Get ready,  because High Pressure System Asshat is just going to be dumping sunshine all over us...\" It further offends me that their motivation in doing this is not to help people prepare for a winter storm system,  but rather to monetize the weather. Finally,  I can only assume that the NOAA already has 'dibs' on all the normal,  professional names so they have to use the stupid &amp;  sensational ones,  so we get things like \"Winter storm Gandalf\" or \"winter storm Goliath.\"  I also work with orphaned and abandoned children in Haiti (this has nothing to do with the weather channel.)

I called her out. She acknowledged the behavior but she refused to apologize.

My best friend from high school did the same, but in the opposite direction. For the first few months of our separation, we would Skype and FaceTime and talk all the time. It wasn't the way things were in high school, but it was sufficing. \n\nThen things started to change. I began making friends and spending more time with them, which meant less time to Skype my friend from home. I still made time to Skype with her a few days a week, but it wasn't a few times a day like it had been. My love for her didn't diminish, but she took my lessened communication to mean that I absolutely loathed her.\n\nWhen I tried to talk to her, she was short with me and made hateful comments about my weight, my preferences in the boys I dated, and everything in between. I got a new boyfriend about a month after the distance between her and I started to really become prominent. Instead of being happy for me adjusting well in college, she sent me AN EMAIL (she didn't even have the decency to text me or call me) that basically stated \"if you don't have time to make me your number one priority, then I don't want to be involved in your life at all. Have fun gaining weight and fucking random boys. Besides, I have a feeling your life is going to be too much of a mess for me to take part in it anymore.\" She also told me why my religion was completely wrong, that I was too stupid to be a doctor so education was my last resort, etc. Basically just a really hateful email.\n\nAnd that was it. I didn't speak to her for a few years-- and the quality of my life definitely improved. I didn't feel suffocated or guilty for having friends in the state I was in anymore. \n\nThen about a year and a half ago, she texted me out of nowhere asking for \"permission to reenter my life\". I, not being vindictive or grudge-holding, let her back in at a distance. I quickly realized that the only reason she wanted any communication with me anymore was so that she could brag about how great her life is. Since I literally could not care less, I didn't acknowledge her attempts to brag and make me feel guilty for \"abandoning her\" (her words...but the nasty email she sent me would imply quite the opposite, I would think). We're friends on Facebook now, but that's it. I have noticed, however, that she continually passes judgement at everything I post. From my engagement to my graduation to my career, she always posts passive aggressive statuses that are clearly aimed towards me. I'm just glad I got off that sinking ship when I did! \n\nTL;DR: Moved away to college, friend got pissed that I started to have a life without her, she sent me an email telling me that since I wasn't her top priority she didn't want anything to do with me.

I don't pay any attention to the CMA's or ACM awards because they are just the same jerk off old hat singers every year, most of them don't even write their own songs. Jason Isbell wrote every song on that album. It's a country album. The Grammy's, getting back to my point have it in the category of Best American Roots Song and Best Americana Album. Well guess what, those categories are not televised, nor do they get to perform on the televised show. So Jason Isbell is deprived of millions of new fans for a record he wrote himself. Guess what else all the \"Country\" nominees are featured on the show. So what's the difference? Jason Isbell is on a small independent label, and makes great music. The \"Country\" artists are on Warner Bros. ,MCA, Capitol, Curb etc... It's not fair, it really isn't.

We're challenging all these traditional roles and views on things....but we don't know what to replace them with just yet, or that perhaps we shouldn't replace them with anything. With people being the social creatures we are, the idea of completely shedding the need or practice of adopting our beliefs and behaviors from social norms (and doing it for ourselves) is something I don't ever see happening. People are too interdependent for that, I think.\n\nAnd lastly, American culture and society has always been such a mix of different cultures that there isn't really one dominant, shared culture. It was revolutionary at the time of our colonization and founding, but again...people just aren't really capable of acting too far from the group. Many people just seem to naturally need some sort of guidance or teaching.

There's good and bad to consider here. There's some things that are sexual and good, and some that are sexual and bad. All I'm really trying to say, is that these concepts still apply to sex. While sex, or anything else, may be physical, that doesn't mean that there's no consequences, even of a spiritual nature. If humans have a spiritual component to them, then everything they do is spiritual. Either way, there's many different beliefs regarding sex, and some of those might hold it to be a sacred thing. That's not hindered by the fact that it's also physical/biological.\n\nI'll also go ahead and make a case for the puritanical thing, just to point out that it's not without sense. Imagine that the best is always good, and that anything less is bad, as an idea of morality. If that's the case, then the same would apply to sex, and it would make sense that some people would be puritans about it. It doesn't even have to be that extreme to get the results that we see though.\n\nAll I'm saying, is that it makes sense that people ascribe these values to sex, and I don't think there's anything wrong with that, unless, of course, that they were ascribing objectively wrong values to it.

People put way too much effort into little things that are irrelevant, and then stress five or so years off their life expectancy when one little thing doesn't go right. Just stop.\n\nYou need to let us guys handle these things. For the same amount of effort and a few seconds of quick imagination we can come up with things that will blow your mind.\n\nFor example: Here's what I've got planned for mine...\n\nSomewhere in the desert...\n\nTractor trailers and buses begin rolling in and setting up a massive infrastructure system that makes Burning Man look like a couple hippies camped out under a lean-to. Food, perishable supplies, and guests are paradropped into the area from nearby cities (to preserve freshness). Family members, bridesmaids/groomsmen, and anyone involved with the actual marital function are also provided with the option of wingsuits and or [jetpacks](https://youtu.be/_VPvKl6ezyc?t=19) for their descent to help set the mood. Anyone not invited is still welcome to attend, but must reach the location on their own.\n\nBarrier walls roughly 20 meters in height are set up into the general shape of a cathedral the size of an Olympic arena with a massive amphitheater at the core and the far end opened so that the festivity can be enjoyed by the rest of the gathering. These barriers are adorned with relevant artwork of various forms on the inside, and have enough protective backing to contain the average munitions dump demolition. The outline of the cathedral is actually rather wide and serves to conceal the world's largest array of custom pyrotechnic artillery. In the distance behind the amphitheater there exists a slender and tall (roughly 150-200m) pyramid covered in mirrors with tracks on either side that allow both halves to separate.\n\nAs the sun sets and the event begins, guests will enter very generous accommodations within the body of the roofless cathedral (beds of pillows, dining tables, hot springs, anything you can imagine), and all entertainment events in the vicinity will cease so the rest of the crowd can approach the open end and spectate the activities. As the last light fades away, the stars vibrantly emerge, and the Milky Way dominates the sky, several science personalities take to the raised dais before the amphitheater (now populated by the cream of the world's symphony crop, who begin to provide soothing and inspiring background music) and host the world's grandest planetarium experience while sharing a message of hope and discovery. As that transcendent experience comes to a peaceful and fulfilling conclusion, the dais is cleared, and the bridesmaids/groomsmen and relevant functionaries take the stage to the backing of sudden and tremendous fanfare from the orchestra behind them.\n\nThe most awesome woman in the world and I take each other's hand as we begin our HALO jump from the aircraft above. Searchlights frantically scan the sky for our descent as air raid sirens go off. It's a bit of a trip down so we occupy ourselves with witty banter of the \"I love you... I know\" and \"Wow, that pressure suit actually does make you look fat\" variety. We open our shoots and begin performing acrobatics overhead while strafing the guests and even attendees outside the facility with pulsing laser pistols (no harm don't worry) as every speaker in the vicinity plays synchronized \"PEW PEW\" laser noises. We land together in front of the dais, remove the jump gear to reveal immaculate attire, and ascend the stairs as some one-off John Williams piece plays. Then we put on our power rings press our fists together and say something along the lines of \"By our powers combined! Super Umutuku Temple of Eternity, Activate!\"\n\nOur begins playing (we'll totally know what it is by then), and we reveal the true purpose of this fully armed and operational wedding station. The pyrotechnic artillery activates and launches a dizzying array of shells into the sky, painting a mile tall temple of light and fury onto the canvas of reality in a pillar of grandeur. We do the traditional thang, and immediately have our first dance under a deluge of photons. Then everything goes silent. \n\nThe lights fade from the sky, and the amphitheater splits in two, opening outward until each half has made a full 180 degree rotation, and providing an unobstructed view of the mirrored pyramid. The entire central venue (guest area and dais) roll out through the opening as the attendant crowd is allowed to stream into the cathedral behind them and then filter around to the sides of the venue in front of each amphitheater half. A kaleidoscope of lasers suddenly begins to ricochet off the reflective pyramid, cutting a galactic battle scene through the ceiling of smoke. We hop on matching sport bikes and ride towards the pyramid as the symphony performs the grandest rendition of Danger Zone in history. As we near the pyramid the lasers intensify and the pyramid separates to reveal a launch platform and our personal rocket yacht. We load up, and blast off to our zero-g honeymoon leaving the masses to revel in our wake.\n\nI'm sure it's really important that your napkins match the roses though.", "is_root": false, "controversiality": 0, "children": 0, "popularity_score": 0.15525360177969558}, {"text": "Mom?

We both attended film school and I helped him with pre pro, production and a ton in post on his film. Then when it comes time to make the company he goes and does all the paper work secretly behind my back and invites the other friends we were making the company with to sign all the papers and purposely leave me out. \n\nOne of the other friends who signed it with him also owed me $450 for 2 ounces I fronted him so he could sell it, this agreement had been going on for a few months where I would front him and he would pay me back later once he had sold it.\n\nA few days later, still in the dark about why I was left out of the signing I just asked him, \"why did so and so have to sign and not me? I helped with way more than he did.\" The reply he gave me was so condescending, all he said was \"You're a drug dealer, I can't have you part of it\". The guy I was fronting to all of a sudden had no money to pay me for the front and his excuse was \"people are being really jewish not spending money around Christmas\". This was literally what he said right before I asked about why I didn't sign any papers.\n\nI was so disgusted by the lies and manipulation I just got up and left saying \"After all I did for you, go fuck yourselves\".\n\nA year later I hear around school he's telling people \"I went crazy and threatened to kill him and his entire family\". I literally have not said a word to him since I left his apartment about 9 months before. I had to actually go to his brother (who I was still selling weed to and had no idea me and his brother weren't talking anymore) and tell him to cut it out or I would be forced to sue him for defamation.\n\nThe friend who was selling my fronted weed still has not paid me, they also claim they told me before but when I asked when they cite a time where we all collectively smoked 7 grams so we could go eat so much we pass out, also I fronted the one friend an ounce before this. It was supposedly talked about during the meal. They said the reason I don't remember is because I had a seizure from some mushrooms they had bought. When I saw them later they were as black as night and moldy. It was one of the most disgusting excuses I had ever heard.\n\nIf they had been upfront about it from the beginning I wouldn't have a problem but they used me and said nothing just to fuck me over in the end. They wanted me to stop selling completely at a time when there was no revenue coming in. Basically telling me to throw away $30k+ a year for nothing. I would have no problem not selling anymore if there was a form of revenue for me to pay my bills and rent, but this was not the case and they knew full well that's how I paid my bills. My plan was to stop once there was money coming in but they wanted to make the decision for me like they were morally superior and leave me to struggle with no income.\n\nThe kicker is once all this happened they tried to get a documentary funded about medical marijuana for use on PTSD, asking for literally half a million for the entire project. It failed spectacularly but the level of hypocrisy can't be made up. I just also want to add the reason you form an LLC is to separate personal assets from the companies so even if something happened to me it wouldn't affect the company. Whenever I tell this story to my banker friend he just gets mad at how dumb of an excuse they used.\n\nTLDR friends fucked me out of a company I helped with more than anyone over me selling weed even though they knew before any talk of the company and the whole time they said I would be a part of it then they made disgusting excuses for themselves and spread completely false rumors about me after the fact.", "is_root": true, "controversiality": 0, "children": 0, "popularity_score": 0.39729354510739606}, {"text": "For me, the motive for a lifelong campaign of destroying everything that bitch ever loved.", "is_root": false, "controversiality": 0, "children": 0, "popularity_score": 0.9643509287436869}, {"text": "I agree.

If you can find a movie willing to let itself be quiet during a sad moment, it feels that much more human, mostly because of how real it is. There's no soundtrack to real life. There's no one riding on your back with a susaphone to signal when things are about to get scary, there's no guy just out of sight pecking away at the piano keys when you're made sad. It's silence.\n\nOf course, the sadder the music is, the more the director is screaming at you to cry, dammit, cry as if your life depended on it. Because most of the time, it's hard to portray legit sadness.\n\nTo contrast this point, find a sad scene. Any sad scene. Then watch this: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g450eyrN7Pg\n\nYou hear that? That silence that falls during Radar's announcement? That's real. That's visceral. It's so real that not a damn member of the cast was informed until Gary Burghoff was handed that piece of paper, and told to go read it to the cast.\n\nIf the movie wants to be sad afterwards, that fine.

Easiest/foolproof one is \"Hey, I like your hair\".  Girls change their hair constantly, so if you tell them it looks good, they'll like hearing it because they're self-conscious if its new.  Bangs and pigtails are the best for me, since I genuinely like them, but pigtails are pretty rare unless you're into the under-10 crowd.  Or if its obvious that she put some effort or money into some aspect of her appearance - if she's wearing bigass boots or a loud dress or a t-shirt with a band on it - say you like it, it looks good, whatever.  Don't comment on her appearance, just say that you like something specific about her.  Not her body.  Don't say \"you got an ass that won't quit\".  You'll just come off as a creep.  Girls express their personality through fashion, so if you can tell she's trying to say something with her appearance, acknowledge that.\n\nAnother one I've used is the \"hey, my friend thinks...\" or \"hey, my friend says\", especially if you can point to that friend and especially if that friend is a girl.  Once I said to a random girl who was wearing this like hippie floral print dress \"hey, your dress makes me think you probably have good taste, but my friend thought that if I told you that, you'd think I was gay.  But she's wearing tights and a north face so wtf does she know about dressing well?\" and I pointed to this hot blonde girl I went to that bar with who was dressed like a typical sorority girl, so the implication was \"you see that hot girl over there?  You're better than her.\"  So you don't just compliment her, you imply that she's better than the other girls there, and you have the air of \"god, this place is so lame.  Look at all these lame people.  You seem cool, though\".  Girls are socially vicious, they love shit-talking and they love feeling better/prettier/smarter than other girls; hence, the \"you're not like all the other girls\" cliche that women love.\n\n\nI'd feel so stupid trying to use a pickup line, which generally are stupid by definition, so I've never even tried, and among the guys I know, the success rate for stock lines is extremely low.

I was passed by a teen couple in a Jeep Cherokee and watched as they signaled and moved ahead of me into the right lane only to be forced to decelerate when they rounded the bend and came upon one of the full sized plow trucks that frequent upstate NY highways.  I saw a brown blur come shooting out from underneath the rear end of the plow truck and skid across the left lane. The jeep in front of me slammed on its brakes and came to a complete standstill.  I looked behind me and saw the silhouette of a dead deer in the left lane and assumed that the Jeep driver had possibly been startled by the same critter. \n\n  When the teen driver put his four way flashers on I hopped out to check on him. The front of the hood was buckled a bit and a horrific smell was burning my nose.  Somehow the large plow truck had also ran over a smaller deer and thrown it hard enough to rupture the layers of skin and muscle that retained the organs.  A large portion of deer innards, fur, and bones was intertwined in the marquee jeep grill.  \nThe teen and his girlfriend were still inside the Jeep and dialing 911 when I approached the window.

There is this faulty logic going around that says that \"buying from a breeder is killing a shelter dog\". Which is far from true. You could just as much say to someone with a nice house and car, \"Hey you could put that money into saving multiple shelter dogs\", so basically that is also killing shelter dogs because you could've adopted them but didn't. If you follow that logic basically any choice that you make instead of adopting a dog from a shelter is killing a dog from a shelter. \n\nI choose to adopt rescues and volunteer my time fostering because I enjoy training and working with dogs that would have been been hard to place otherwise. I'm one of the few people I know of in the rescue world that won't hesitate to recommend a good breeder to someone if it seems the best fit for what they want. \n\nAlso, a good breeder is typically going to charge $1000+ for a puppy. Its the only way to somewhat recoup costs from doing things right. You are really stacking the odds in your favor when it comes to the health of the dog. For example, you could seriously minimize the risk of severe hip dysplasia, which could just in itself be a $7500 surgery to fix! Not to mention the lifetime of free advice and support from the breeder, as well as a place for your dog to go should something happen to you and all your backup plans for your dog fall through. A goof breeder will also do their absolute best to match you with a puppy that's personality and energy level is best suited for your lifestyle. \nSorry, this is just something I really care a lot about and have unfortunately rare views for someone involved in rescue.

Sure some people were disappointed, some people didn't like it and expected something else. And the fact that a show of that caliber was ending just made the ending even more bitter for most. I came to realize that most of the disappointed people *did* misunderstand the ending and thought of it as a cop-out. Of course if the ending *was* \"the plane never crashed\", then of course it would be disappointing. The media didn't help either, with talk shows and big celebrities talking about how they didn't like that hey changed the timeline.

Perhaps an island in the Atlantic, such as the Azores, or in the Pacific, like one of the many Polynesian islands.\n\nThe city's primary purpose would be governance, and services to assist in that purpose.

This would probably create an unusual culture within the city, where friendships outside of work are temporary, at best.\n\nThe city would also need another purpose, too, in order to sustain it. Tourism may help, but it wouldn't provide the complete revenue to maintain its infrastructure. Since it would be on an island, either manmade or natural, then it could have industries that use ocean-based resources.

In the show, Rick kills Shane and then Carl shoots Zombie Shane. Ok. He had to shoot a zombified friend. In the comics, Shane threatens to kill rick and Carl straight up kills Shane. A 7 year old kid sees his father in danger and makes a life altering decision to kill a person. Imagine how much that fucks with his head, imagine how that fucks with Rick's head, seeing his son, someone who he is supposed to protect from the evils in the world, sacrifice their innocence for their father's life.\n\nThere are numerous instances like this where the show fell short of defining the characters.

Wife accomodated this. Then proceeded to barely speak to either of us, show up to anything, then turned up on the day - got fairly drunk, hooked up with an old friend of mine (he was one of the few single and good looking guys there and basically did it because everyone else was interested), then got cold feet, started chatting up my best man even though he'd had numerous attempts chatting her up in the past denied purely to start a fight between them, then spent the rest of the night on my middle aged uncle's lap. Never spoke to her again. \n\nHad a guest (said guy she hooked up with above) at the end of the night drunkenly realise \"Oh wait, I didn't get you anything for a gift\" and then proceed to empty out the loose change out of his wallet to the grand total of about $8 and hand it to me without batting an eyelid. \"Thanks but no thanks\"..\n\nGave a groomsman a +1 on his invite for his fiancee who decided not to show up until about 30 minutes to go, and started beeping the horn at him to go. When he stayed to chat, only then did she come in and help herself to a meal. Barely hear from him again after it, except for an awkward Facebook chat where he starts telling me all about how his wedding preparations were going and glad he sent the last of his wedding invites out a week ago. Most awkward way of telling me imaginable.\n\nHad this guy's crazy wife who I really didn't want to invite but kinda pressured into it as the mountain of stories over the years that had been told about her meant that everyone wanted to see the craziness in person. 15 minutes into the bands' set, she storms over to me angrily and demands that the sound be turned down as it was too loud in there and was giving her a headache. Everyone else in the conversation she just interrupted to tell me this just give her a huge \"WTF?\" look as the accoustic duo play on at a relatively normal sound level, only to go over and tell the band that I had instructed them to turn the sound down. When they clarify this with me I tell them to turn it up. She storms off into the entrance way and starts trying to drag other guests out there to have her own party instead. It's awkward watching her out there by herself. Thank you for the $10 tupperware set as a wedding gift. \n\nInvited a heap of people from a football forum I frequent to come. Some were really close friends, others I invited to ensure they all had people to talk to and it was nice to have them all in one place to catch up.  One forgot to fix her privacy settings and put up this huge Facebook rant about how rude it was that we'd asked people to contribute to our honeymoon as a gift rather than traditional wedding gifts as we'd been living together for a while, decided not to bring anything, and then got absolutely trashed on the open bar, before taking my partner aside and itemising how much she spent on the night - dress, spray tan, etc. Muchly awkward.\n\nHad a pair of twins who had tried to sabotage our entire relationship, I reluctantly agreed to invite them. Spent the night in the corner bitching about me and didn't speak to me the entire time.\n\nRealistically, if you run into this many assholes, you're the asshole.", "is_root": true, "controversiality": 0, "children": 0, "popularity_score": 1.738400416923504}, {"text": "'Idiot Hotel' - Thursdays at 8 on Nickelodon.", "is_root": false, "controversiality": 0, "children": 0, "popularity_score": 0.19045939061587822}, {"text": "I'm disappointed with how the show has written her compared to the books.

Thirty-two percent of these were in men who probably acquired their infection through sex with another man. Fifty-four percent acquired their infection heterosexually and about 2% through injecting drug use. Most of the heterosexuals were probably infected abroad.\nFor heterosexual teenagers the risk of catching chlamydia, gonorrhoea or another sexually transmitted infection is far higher than the risk of catching HIV. Those infected with another sexually transmitted infection are at a higher risk of acquiring HIV if they have an HIV infected partner. \nHow do you catch HIV?\nHIV is passed on from an infected person through the transfer of body fluids such as blood, semen, fluid from the woman\u2019s cervix and breast milk.\nThere are four main ways to catch HIV:\n- By unprotected sexual intercourse (anal, vaginal or oral) with an infected partner.\n- Anal intercourse (where a man\u2019s penis is inserted into his partner\u2019s anus) is more dangerous than vaginal intercourse. This is because the lining of the anus is easily damaged. The lining of the vagina and skin in general, if undamaged, is relatively resistant to HIV.\n- The virus is passed on more readily from men to women than from women to men.\n- The risk associated with unprotected oral sex is lower than other forms of penetrative sex, but is not risk free.\nBy an injection or transfusion with blood from an infected person.\nThrough drug users sharing needles and syringes contaminated with HIV infected blood.\nFrom an infected mother to her baby during birth or through breast feeding.\nHIV is NOT passed on through everyday social contact with an infected person. Touching, shaking hands, hugging, coughing or sneezing cannot pass on the virus.\nNot everyone who comes into contact with the virus will contract it. For example, most babies born to HIV positive mothers are not infected with the virus.

A group of us high school friends decided to watch the Lord of the rings extended editions because I had never seen them. While watching the second movie, at least 6 hours in, me and one of my friends were discussing the attractiveness of the hobbits. We agreed hands down that Merry is the most attractive hobbit. Shit friend disagreed and said Pippin was most attractive. We berated him and said he was clearly wrong, all in jest I thought. We end the day, not finishing the movies, shit friend drives me home with us joking the whole time. \nThe next morning I wake up to a long message from him explaining how upset he was that we thought one hobbit was more attractive than the one he thought was attractive. I thought he was joking because it was about the ATTRACTIVENESS OF HOBBITS. One highlight of our conversation on this topic was me explaining that we had been joking and him saying, \"That's what bullies say to justify their actions.\" \n\nWhen I needed time to myself after a lot of family stuff happened to me he could not accept that and kept making himself the victim and not giving me time.

My HS sociology teacher (a really down to Earth guy who doesn't buy into all of the college hype) told us we should at least consider it because the flexibility of setting your own schedule and the general pace and feel of things makes a huge difference compared to high school.\n\nMy biggest complaint with high school (as I said in my original comment) is that teachers have zero respect for your time.  I'm on winter break at the moment and have a huge-ass book to read.  College kids are off for two more weeks and have no responsibilities because their classes have ended.  Even when I get a break, it's really not a break.  It's just less work.\n\nThe saddest part is that I can't figure out why some teachers do this sort of thing.  They aren't bad people.  They actually think it's helping.  They KNOW the stress it puts us under.  They KNOW we only do it for the grades.  They KNOW whatever packet they make us do or book they make us read will ultimately have no impact on our education.  It's incredibly frustrating when you have these excellent and incredibly nice people beat you over the head with so much work it brings you to tears.\n\nI fear it's only going to get worse for high school students.  Duel enrollment will be the next \"AP class\" for people wanting to go to college.  It used to be that AP classes were only for the best of the best.  Now, any schmuck whose parents want their baby to go to an Ivy League can get put into one as long as the parents sign off.  My AP classes are absolutely massive now and are just as overcrowded as the rest of the school.  \n\nHowever, a very small pocket of those AP kids are being shipped off on a school bus a few times a week to a local university for duel enrollment courses.  Once the rest of the country catches on, it's over.  The kids going to college will be all caught up in that business.  As you said, it's already an uphill battle to get into a mid-tier school.  Guess what?  It's only getting higher from here.\n\nI don't even blame the colleges for this mess.  It's a societal problem.  At some point in the past 25-30 years America decided everyone needed to go to college.  Because our system is broken at its core, this is the result.  Rather than college being a place for higher education where people who loved learning and did well in school could attend, it's now where society expects you to go.  Colleges are being forced to be more selective than ever every single day.\n\nI'm ranting at this point.

We also learned that if there was a question no one in the class could get on their own, *and* he wouldn't give any information about it, then we were probably okay because no one would get it and he likely knew it would be hard and the curve would save us anyway.\n\n&gt;Other than those 2, I rarely go to office hours because more than likely (in my experience), if the prof can't explain it in class, he's not gonna be able to explain in office hours and im better off googling.\n\n\nThis is not necessarily true, from my experience.  Some professors suck at lecturing but are good at giving explanations 1 on 1.  Also, sometimes when you explain what you didn't understand after the lecture, they can help clarify things.

My heart stopped pumping for 9 minutes. (V-FIB which is effectively not pumping) I survived because I was working in a hospital near a time clock at a shift change time. There were nurses and a crash cart nearby, and a coworker noticed that I was gone. I was being given CPR within a minute and my life was saved with no symptoms of brain damage. Immediate medical care and God's Grace saved my life. Or a luck supernova. The problem with my heart was electrical not physical and I recovered completely. ( don't drink taurine in energy drinks...it's bad) There was no warning that I was blacking out. When I came to in the ER they were getting ready to cool me down to reduce brain damage. I had a near death experience that changed my outlook forever. I walked down a corridor towards a place I had to get to. There was music and laughter. I remember Bach and Zydeco playing down side corridors. I sat and listened for a while with a chance companion. It was peaceful. The corridor was carpeted and had wainscoting and was warmly lit by sconces. The ceiling was vaulted. I knew that I was in a good place. I knew I had to get to the front desk (?). Then voices started calling for me to come back. They angered me. I liked it there. Then I awoke within a minute of my wife's arrival to the ER. She had gotten lost and it was 2.5 hours after my collapse. I awoke at her voice. I was intubated and they were putting a central line into my neck area. It took a year to fully recover from the experience, but it is a before and after moment for me. Since then I have seen one of my kids get married. Grandchildren have been born.

Hip hop artists began wearing grills in the early 1980s; New Yorker Eddie Plein, owner of Eddie's Gold Teeth, is often credited with starting the trend. Plein made gold caps for Flavor Flav, and then outfitted New York rappers including Big Daddy Kane and Kool G. Rap. He later moved to Atlanta, where he designed ever-more-elaborate grills for rappers like OutKast, Goodie Mob, Ludacris, and Lil Jon. Other writers have cited Slick Rick as an important early contributor to the popularity of grills.\n\nGrills remained popular in the Southern U.S., especially in Houston or Memphis, even as they rose and fell from popularity elsewhere, and the rise of Dirty South rappers in the 2000s spurred a nationwide grill trend. During this time, grills frequently appeared in hip hop music, most notably in the 2005 number one single \"Grillz,\" by Nelly, Paul Wall, Big Gipp, and Ali, and in other Paul Wall songs. Wall is known for his grill business as well as his rapping; his clients include Kanye West and Cam'ron.\n\nGrills maintained their popularity into the 2010s, with French grillmaker Dolly Cohen creating custom oral jewelry for Rihanna, Cara Delevingne, and Rita Ora.

We both took violin lessons together. There was a musical group in town where local youth would audition and perform, and I got chosen to play fiddle in the band. She immediately auditioned afterward, and they decided to use both of us. I was wearing a certain shirt one day and she asked where I got it. The next day she was wearing the same shirt. I got my hair cut short. A week later she has the same hair cut. She even said things like \"so that we can be twins!\" etc. Then things got weird. She'd show up to rehearsals early and learn my songs, and tell the band director I told her she could play them.  She started telling everyone a ton of lies about me and my family that got more and more serious (like, telling people that my dad was abusive and would beat my brother and I if we played a wrong note). She sabotaged every performance I did. Nobody would talk to me anymore, and I would end up being alone on one side of the dressing room because nobody even wanted to sit next to me. I would cry every time I just walked into the building. I didn't want to quit and let her win, but eventually I had to for my sanity. Congratulations Rachel, you bitch. I hope being the *only fiddle player in some shitty local band* was all you'd ever hoped it would be and more.\n\nThe same thing happened in college, essentially (though my friend wasn't a bitch like that first girl). She had no musical talent whatsoever, but since I did music she would always try to sing over me and whatnot. She joined my music fraternity. She started wearing my clothes. She moved into my apartment. She tried to become better friends with my friends (who were all dudes, so that she could be their \"best girl friend\" or whatever). She started dating my boyfriend's best friend.  She started working at the same place I did. And *one* day I expressed an interest in something that she was good at and she flipped out and yelled at me in front of all her friends, saying that it was *her* thing, not mine. Okay. My boyfriend hated her, because she didn't treat his best friend very well while they were dating. She knew he didn't like her so one day she gave me an ultimatum: him or her.\n\nHe's now my fiance, and basically my only close friend now. I'm okay with that.

If you do get shitty grades there look for a uni with an entrance exam since they usually don't care about grades.\n\nGet really drunk one time, slowly, over the course of a few hours slow, with someone you trust. That way you will know the signs of you starting to get drunk and be able to stop, I've seen people keep drinking because they had no idea what their limit was then pass out on a bench in the middle of winter. If/when you d get drunk with friends stop drinking immediately because there will already be alcohol in your body to keep you drunk for a while.\n\nGet some exercise going. It's easy in HS because your parents will always remind you to do it. I've been trying to pick up running again for a month now and I keep forgetting.\n\nGames/tv shows will always be there, unique events will not. Go to birthdays, go to parties, and spend time with your family, the pause button is there for a reason. If you play online games with cash shops (LoL/CSGO) don't pay a dime for skins because eventually you will quit/want to quit and skins just make it harder because you have an interest now.\n\nFind a hobby, something physical. An instrument, a sport, whatever but something that you keep you entertained for long periods of time. Blackouts or lack of internet is a thing and as a gamer that usually kills my source of entertainment.\n\n\nRead, find a genre you like. Tv shows/ movies are great and all but there is A LOT of stories out there that are really cool but nobody touches them because it would be too expensive. \n\nAcne sucks, deal with it, 50$ remedies from professional makeup companies didn't do shit for me, instead I found this weird ointment that some pharmacist made in small batches and that did wonders. Try stuff and you will probably find what you need.\n\nAvoid Jager at all costs.\n\nLearning to make cocktails makes you seem REALLY cool, probably because it is really cool.\n\nDrugs are fun and all but being ruled by them is awful. Avoid the hard stuff and make sure you use the light stuff in moderation.", "is_root": false, "controversiality": 0, "children": 0, "popularity_score": 0.8170026072652448}, {"text": "From Software's games.", "is_root": true, "controversiality": 0, "children": 0, "popularity_score": 0.3607380581367536}, {"text": "Reboot", "is_root": true, "controversiality": 0, "children": 0, "popularity_score": 1.0896837645588284}, {"text": "Explosive Diarrhea ", "is_root": true, "controversiality": 0, "children": 0, "popularity_score": 0.6206774654573253}, {"text": "Lost.", "is_root": true, "controversiality": 0, "children": 0, "popularity_score": 0.12529772280442017}, {"text": "Not a bus driver.

We tried to get out by breaking down some pine saplings and cramming them under the tires.  My friend would climb to the top and bend it down, and we would grab it and pull until it snapped.

Her cousin, aunt's daughter, was one of her brides maids.  Well when we all went to the store to find dresses, all she did was complain and say how everything that my friend picked out would look horrible on her daughter, and she should know what works best because she was a seamstress, and she should pick THIS dress, and blah blah.  So my friend, of course, puts up with NONE of it.  She tells her if she continues to act this way, her daughter will NOT be in the wedding.  It is her wedding and this is what she wants.  Aunt shut up for the most part, kept muttering and what not about what a horrible choice she made for brides maids dresses.  She wanted her daughter to have one size, but it was too small, so my friend said, \"Well, if she doesn't fit in the dress on my wedding day, she won't be in the wedding.  Since you are a master seamstress and you don't want to pay for alterations, get the bigger one and alter it yourself.\"  Needless to say, the larger dress was ordered, yet on the wedding day, no alterations were made, and we all had to McGyver her dress so it didn't fall off.  Also, said aunt insisted that she make all the boutineers and bouquets.  So she had a mock up that she showed my friend, and all she had asked of her was to have everything done a week before the wedding.  Yea...didn't happen.  She showed up late so none of the flowers were in the pictures.  Luckily my friend liked them, otherwise I think her aunt's body would have been found later out back.  Oh also, when we were all helping to set up the venue she was an absolute nightmare.  Two instances were we were she was tasked with putting a tablecloth on the dj table.  She taped it to the front.  I shit you not.  I took it off and put it on right, making sure that it draped to cover the whole front of the table to the ground.  Another was the card cage (bird cage where you put your cards, looks cute).  There was some ivy that my friend wanted to look nice with the cage.  She took it and just flopped it around the bottom of the cage on the table.  I too fixed it, tucking it up and around the bars, making it look decent instead of half-assed.  \n\nI've helped photograph a wedding before and the maid of honor couldn't be arsed to show up for pictures before the wedding, so we took them without her.  Bride was really chill about it, didn't bat an eye.  She showed up before the ceremony and was doing her makeup while we finished photos.  She wasn't in any of the photos.  \n\nLast one, my sister's friend got married.  Oh, this was...wow.  So the friend's mom and sister were tasked with making bookmarks that would be handed out.  They had a month to do it, small-ish wedding, like under 150 people.  They still weren't done the night before the wedding.  Then they got pissed when their grandmother tasked us with helping to get them done.  The friend's sister's baby-daddy kept calling my sister's friend's cell phone because her sister didn't have one, because he was mad she was out of state (he couldn't come because probation).  I later found out that the groom's father and step mother were a piece of work as well, and I thought his side of the family was normal.  Other things have happened with both sides of their family since then and I am surprised that they are as normal as they are.", "is_root": true, "controversiality": 0, "children": 0, "popularity_score": 1.2424618397059644}, {"text": "i am this way except with reptiles.\n\nmany people see turtles / tortoises, chameleons, frogs, geckos, etc at petco and decide they look easy enough.\n\nfact is, petco does an absolute SHIT job at keeping these animals.\n\nthat chameleon you saw in that glass cage with the dirt? yeah. no. that chameleon will eventually need an open-air (screen) cage at least 24x24x48\". it will need live plants and temperature control. it needs basking lights and a uvb tube. it needs at least 3 different feeder bugs and 2 different types of\ncalcium supplement. it needs humidity and temp drop at night too. \n\nthose baby tortoises are going to need an entire YARD of space, and NO you cannot just feed them lettuce and broccoli their whole lives. they may live over 30 yrs. they need proper heat during the winter so they dont freeze (or they might hibernate depending on the species).\n\nthose betta fish cant stay in a tiny vase. they need space like any other animal.\n\nthose frogs arent disposable. you need to feed them bugs and plant their enclosures, give them hiding space and humidity and uvb. \n\nthose leo geckos sure are cute but theyve probably gulped down some fucking sand from petcos cages and will be impacted in their gut. dont fucking put sand in any reptiles cage unless its a sandfish. the geckos need calcium, uvb, heat, hiding space, humid and dry spots...\n\nbearded dragon you saw? no, it CANT live with another. it shouldnt. there is always a chance one of them could bite the other, no matter how much they \"like\" each other. they can bully each other for food and bite each others toes off. they need at least a 50gal cage as an adult and a 90+ degree heat lamp. they need darkness at night and a uvb at day. they need calcium and crickets and dubia roaches and a variety of bugs. they need baths unless you want them to stink like fuck. and for fucks sake NO you cant keep it on sand or \"ground up seeds\". or calci sand. calci sand is the WORST for impaction. \n\nand for gods fucking sake, just bc you keep a reptile in small cage does NOT mean IT Will stay small.\n\npetco and petsmart specifically are just fucking terrible. but even mom and pop stores are bad.\n\none of the stores i went to the other day had a beardie adult in a 10g cage and only MOSS. it was also seemingly choking on the moss.\n\nanother store i used to go to had a chameleons lights off during the day because it \"wasnt dark yet\". ummm....

What wasn't fine was that she basically abandoned her 6mo old baby on us for a few weeks. We kicked her out, she took forever to get her stuff, we kept her sweet TV and her grandmother's antique dining room table (and gave it away to someone a few months ago).  This was 5 years ago.\n\nAnother was because I didn't \"approve of his lifestyle\" - he was a male in a female's body. We called him Blaine, used male pronouns like he wanted, and we even let him move in with us for a short while because he needed some space from his parents.  We let his girlfriend come over and stay with him while we were on our honeymoon.  But somehow we just didn't approve of his lifestyle...*eyeroll*\n\nAnother one is a good friend of Blaine ^^^ - she didn't like that I didn't follow her dramatic, tumblr views about certain things. Ex: I fucking love Chik-fil-A and Dominos, but because they're owned by \"christian assholes\", apparently I support their views by eating their food. She actually told me she thinks less of me because I eat there. Fuck you, i love their food, and i'm not changing.  Blaine and this lady were actually in our wedding party, interestingly enough.  Our falling out with them was about...5 months after our wedding?  I have a few stories about this bitch taking advantage of us and being rude, and being kind of a cunt about things.\n\nAnother set of friends (a couple named Dan and Kara) got all bent out of shape about a story my husband told me in our apartment with an open window.  We lived on the third floor.  Dan had to be listening *hard* to hear the story.  Bill (husband) was telling me how his friend told him he \"could totally fuck Kara\", and Bill laughed and said he told his friend, \"dude Kara would fuck you up...don't even think about that shit.\"  Well Dan heard this, bowed up on Bill and was all, \"I don't appreciate you talking about my wife like that\", to which we laughed and were confused because...we didn't say anything disrespectful?  So we get him to drop it, and go back to his apartment across the hall.  A few days later, Kara confronts me about the story, says we are lying and that Dan told her the truth (which, obviously, he told her a twisted version of the story), and that was pretty much it.\n\nAll of this was in the past 5 years.

I happen to be a straight male, who was college age at the time. Several my female friends had stories of going to the same clinic for PAP smears, breast exams, and birth control (we were poor college students and the cost of medical care in the U.S. was/is insane) and being screamed at by a phalanx of angry people, mostly men. Regardless of where I stood on the issue of abortion, I thought being terrorized on the way to get medical care was cruel and insane. \n\nI mentioned to Bob that, as a gay male who was out, he might want to rethink actively protesting in such a fashion. I tried to explain to him how the women I knew who went to the clinic did so for basic medical exams, and not abortions. I pointed out that the community Bob belonged to regularly had suffered terribly at the hands of less-tolerant people and outright homophobes. This was a long time before Matthew Shepard, in fact. I also reminded Bob the religious zealots who he protested with also had a deep hatred for gay people. \n\nBob lost his shit. He simply wouldn't see the connection or irony between actively terrorizing women alongside people who would be happy to see he himself being terrorized for his sexual preferences. Bob unleashed personal attacks on me, with serious venom spewed in letters and emails. I was shocked at the hatred for me coming from a friend I always accepted as he was. We were close buds, but it was like some fucking Star Wars movie where you discover someone you trusted was actually a dark Sith lord. I'm not kidding. Night and day behavior. I wrote him one last time to tell him I would've happily kept our feelings about abortion private and continued our friendship, but since he really crossed the line with the personal attacks, I now knew how he felt about me, despite what I thought was a close friendship.\n\nFor about eight years after I ended my association with him, Bob sent me emails and mailed me newspaper clippings when my career made the news. I missed him for a long time afterwards, but to know that he had stored up such bile for me while continuing along with a completely different personality was just too creepy.
